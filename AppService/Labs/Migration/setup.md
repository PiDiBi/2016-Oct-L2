# Migration Lab Setup

The goal of this document is to help you prepare for the migration labs. The requirements for this lab are relatively minimal, and chances are you already meet them, save for the source code for the applications, which you can obtain from GitHub. In order to complete the labs, you will need the following pieces of software installed on either your local system or a virtual machine.

For all labs, you will need a Git client installed. If you are using Windows, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## ASP.NET labs

### Software

- [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)

### Source code

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeekTrainer/Expenses.MVC). You may receive a couple of warnings when opening the solution that can be ignored.

## Node.js labs

### Software
