# Opening ports to a Linux VM in Azure
You open a port, or create an endpoint, to a virtual machine (VM) in Azure by creating a network filter on a subnet or VM network interface. You place these filters, which control both inbound and outbound traffic, on a Network Security Group attached to the resource that receives the traffic. Let's use a common example of web traffic on port 80.

## Quick commands
To create a Network Security Group and rules you need the Azure CLI in Resource Manager mode (`azure config mode arm`).

Create your Network Security Group, **entering your own names and location appropriately**:

```
azure network nsg create --resource-group TestRG --name TestNSG --location westus
```

Add a rule to allow HTTP traffic to your webserver (or adjust for your own scenario, such as SSH access or database connectivity):

```
azure network nsg rule create --protocol tcp --direction inbound --priority 1000 \
    --destination-port-range 80 --access allow --resource-group TestRG --nsg-name TestNSG --name AllowHTTP
```

Associate the Network Security Group with your VM's network interface:

```
azure network nic set --resource-group TestRG --name TestNIC --network-security-group-name TestNSG
```

Alternatively, you can associate your Network Security Group with a virtual network subnet rather than just to the network interface on a single VM:

```
azure network vnet subnet set --resource-group TestRG --name TestSubnet --network-security-group-name TestNSG
```
